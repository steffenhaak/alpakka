  # To run the IntegrationSpec against Google Cloud:
  # * go to the console at https://console.cloud.google.com
  # * Create a compute engine service account as documented at https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#creating_a_service_account
  # * Point GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the downloaded JSON key and start sbt
  # * Create a project, and update IntegrationSpec to use that project ID rather than "alpakka"
  # * Under 'Pub/Sub', 'Topics' create a topic 'simpleTopic' with a Google-managed key
  # * Under 'Pub/Sub', 'Subscriptions' create a subscription 'simpleSubscription' for this topic
  # * For 'republish', also create 'testTopic' and 'testSubscription'
  # * Comment out these test settings:

  host = "localhost"
  port = 8538
  use-tls = false # no TLS
  rootCa = "none"
  callCredentials = "none" # no authentication
