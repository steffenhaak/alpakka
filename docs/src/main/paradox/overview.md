# Overview

The [Alpakka project](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka/current/) is an open source initiative to implement stream-aware and reactive integration pipelines for Java and Scala. It is built on top of [Akka Streams](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/index.html), and has been designed from the ground up to understand streaming natively and provide a DSL for reactive and stream-oriented programming, with built-in support for backpressure. Akka Streams is a [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) and JDK 9+ [java.util.concurrent.Flow](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html)-compliant implementation and therefore [fully interoperable](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/general/stream/stream-design.html#interoperation-with-other-reactive-streams-implementations) with other implementations.

If you'd like to know what integrations with Alpakka look like, have a look at our 
@ref[self-contained examples](examples/index.md) section.

There are a few blog posts and presentations about Alpakka out there, we've @ref[collected some](other-docs/webinars-presentations-articles.md).
