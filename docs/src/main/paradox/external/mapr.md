# MapR Database

The Akka Streams connector for MapR Database can be used **to read from and write** to the
[MapR Database](https://mapr.com/products/mapr-database/), via [Reactive Streams](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) with **asynchronous back pressure**.

MapR Database is a high-performance NoSQL database management system built into the MapR Data Platform. It is a highly scalable multi-model database that brings together operations and analytics as well as real-time streaming and database workloads to enable a broader set of next-generation data-intensive applications in organizations.

The library can be used both in Java and Scala, similarly to the approach used by Akka and Alpakka.
